'''Summary of Windows 10X:'''

'''There’s a good chance you’ve heard about Windows 10X, the new version of Windows that’s about to be released. And if you have, there’s a reasonable chance you’re confused about what exactly it is.'''

'''You’re not alone. Microsoft has released confusing, sometimes clashing information about the new operating system. We’re here to help. Read on for everything you need to know about the upcoming Windows 10 variant.'''

'''Windows 10X resembles Windows 10 in some ways but has been built entirely on code from a universal Windows codebase called Windows Core OS. (Windows 10 also uses code from Windows Core OS but adds unique code of its own.).'''

'''Windows 10X won’t replace Windows 10, and it eliminates many Windows 10 features including File Explorer, although it will have a greatly simplified version of that file manager. Its interface is simpler and more stripped down than Windows 10, and it will run only on hardware designed for it, not on hardware that currently runs Windows 10.'''

'''About this cursor set:'''

'''This cursor set is an ultra modern, black and sharp style sized cursor set for use with Windows 10X. Users may choose to use that cursor set on normal Windows 10 machines but this cursor set is more useful for Windows 10X. Please be aware that Windows 10X is a stripped down version of Windows 10, which runs on dual screen tablets and laptops. That is the reason why this cursor set does not come with any additional action cursor roles like "Location Select" and "Person Select". All the cursors in this set are black, except the two cursors with the spinning wheels. This cursor set has a total of 20 cursor roles.'''
